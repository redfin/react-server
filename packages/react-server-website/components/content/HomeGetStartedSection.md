## Getting Started with React Server

The easiest way to get started is with our [yeoman generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-react-server). Open your terminal and type:

```bash
# install yeoman
npm install -g yo

# install the react-server generator
npm install -g generator-react-server

# make a new react-server project in the CURRENT directory
yo react-server

# compile and run the new app
npm run compile
npm run start

# go to http://localhost:3010
```

That hooks you up with [react-server-cli](/docs/guides/react-server-cli), which will take care of the server part and get you up and running right away.
